Based on the Figma design provided, this is the third project of the Software Engineering bootcamp at TripleTen.

It was made not only with HTML and CSS but also with its elements displayed on popular screen sizes (e.g., desktop and mobile screen resolutions).

**Project Features**

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM File Structure
- Media Queries
- Figma
- Images

**Enhancement Plans**

Enhancing this project will entail adding new features to be learned in upcoming sprints.

# [UPDATE] Project 7: Around the U.S. (cont.)

**Overview**

Project 7 builds on the theory and practice laid out from projects 3 through 6.

The basic goal of this project is to learn how to render six cards through JavaScript.

In doing so, we are introduced to the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as it applies to JavaScript.

Previous concepts like functions are further expanded to cover more advanced ones like Classes, for example.

**Project Features**

-OOP
-Modular JS
-JS Classes

**Enhancement Plans**

Based on Sprint 8, enhancing this project will entail applying more advanced concepts and tasks learned in the Software Engineering bootcamp, such as Interfaces in OOP, and Webpack among others.

# [UPDATE] Project 8: Around the U.S. (cont.)

**Overview**

Project 8's focus of the "Around the U.S." series has been introducing students to such technologies as NodeJS and Webpack.

As we learned both technologies, we were introduced to concepts like Advanced OOP, for example. 

More specifically, we learned how to bundle and build with Webpack as well as how to handle Syntax and Interfaces through Advanced OOP.

**Project Features**

-NodeJS
-Webpack
-Advanced OOP

**Enhancement Plans**

Based on Sprint 9, enhacing this project will entail learning more advanced concepts and skills. These concepts and skills will include applying Asynchronous JavaScript and working with  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
